				Overall, I am passionate about tech and computing (my father's fault for sitting me in front of a computer when I was 3 years old). In the last few years, I have been strongly interested in programming, cryptography, and all the topics related to the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem, to which I would like to contribute as an engineer in the future.
			</p> <br/>
			<p>
				Currently, I'm finishing my technical high school education in the field of programming, and next year I am going to start studying systems engineering at UNICEN with the expectation of nurturing myself to contribute to the world in the future.
